## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently focused on the development of websites and databases, with a keen interest in AI and data science, which I plan to explore further in the near future. 

This summer, I will begin learning Spring and Angular, while also striving to master JavaScript and SQL. You can anticipate many more projects as I expand my expertise in these areas.
